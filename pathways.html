                The <a href="https://techgrounds.nl/pathways/" style="text-decoration:underline">Pathways</a> program is
                a 4 week course designed to give
                an impression of different aspects of IT. The goal is to find which IT jobs fit you and how to get
                yourself ready for that job. At the end of these 4 weeks, I needed to answer the below 7 questions for
                myself.

                <div>
                    <p class="pathways_response" ID="response_1">I definitely want to be a developer. I had
                        this idea in my head even before starting Pathways, but I wanted to get a feel for other fields
                        of work before making a final choice. Even though I've seen some other interesting fields like
                        Cyber Security and Cloud Engineering, it's Software Engineering that mostly calls out to me.
                        There's something about just typing in text and making things happen. Figuring out your options
                        and making it work. And when something doesn't work, trying to solve the puzzle and figuring
                        out what went wrong. Heck, I'm doing my final presentation as an actual website instead of a
                        PowerPoint presentation, so that should say enough. <br><br>
                        As to my actual specialization, I haven't figured that part out. There's no specific programming
                        language that I have a preference for, so I guess that mostly comes down to chance. I like the
                        idea of being a full stack developer and have in depth knowledge of both front-end and back-end.
                        So I'll just continue to pick up courses I think I need for further development as I go.<br><br>
                        I do need to give an honorable mention to the Salesforce Trailblazer course. While I'm not
                        interested in learning Salesforce per se, I do love how they gamified the learning process,
                        earning badges like you would trophies and achievements in games and working your way up that
                        way. A modern and playful way of learning. Thumbs up!

                    even though the lessons were very basic, with the help of Google I found the answers I needed.
                    That's part of why I decide to do this presentation in website form, just to see if I could.

                <p class="pathways_response" ID="response_4"> The ideal work environment, I'm guessing that's more or
                    less the
                    same for most people, but here's my version at least. <br><br>
                    In an ideal world I would work in a workplace where quality and hard work are not only encouraged,
                    but actually appreciated. Where you get the trust and freedom to do your job and not get
                    micro-managed. Where an employee is more than a number, and where there is a focus on
                    keeping people happy and healthy so they can perform at their best. Where colleagues take a genuine
                    interest in one another and where you can be free to ask for or give help where needed, so you can
                    learn from each other. That would be the ideal work culture. And I've really enjoyed working with
                    people from all different kinds of nationalities in the past, so I guess that would the part of the
                    ideal work environment as well.<br><br>
                    Besides that, it would be nice to have the chance to keep following your interests. If there's
                    another direction you want to go in, that you can train yourself and know you can move in that
                    direction.

                    should be swapped around. Cause the WHAT part of what I want to learn are mostly the skills that I'm
                    missing in my T-shape. As for the HOW part, looking at the way I interpreted the T-Shape question,
                    I'm mostly missing hard skils. There are multiple ways of learning these. Primarily I will be
                    doing a 5 month long (9 to 5) school course after Pathways in which I will be learning a lot of new
                    hard skills. After that I will stasrt working. If I feel like there are still skills that I'm
                    missing, I will supplement those with online studies.

                <p class="pathways_response" ID="response_6"> So the question what a T-shape for a developer looks like
                    is hard to answer. You can take it extremely broad and list all the programming languages and also
                    all the skills of other IT disciplines you narrowly work with. The latter provides a problem in it's
                    own right, as I have no idea what people I will be working with. Listing this would be of nu use to
                    me at all, since it's not a realistic goal. These are things that develop over time and if there's a
                    need to broaden the dash part of the T, I will figure that out in time. <br><br>So instead I chose
                    to honor the spirit of the exercise, but form my T a bit differently. On the top part of the T, I
                    listed the skills that are generally asked for in any developer job. So these are not in-depth
                    knowledge of any specific field, but skills that are either mandatory or good to have.
                    On the I part of the T-shape are the skills that are more in-depth. These vary from job to job, so
                    while one job would require HTML, CSS and JavaScript, another might need Python or Java. <br><br>
                    In <span class="green_text">green</span> I have listed the skills I already have. In <span
                        class="red_text">red</span> are the skills I still need and which I am
                    going to focus on. Note that as mentioned earlier, I will focus only on some of the skills in the I
                    part, as not all are relevant to all jobs.
